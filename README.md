# HR_Attrition_Data_Analysis

## Aim
The main aim of this model is to discuss employee attrition prediction i.e. predicting that employee will leave the current company (or will resign from the current company) and we will do this using machine learning algorithm. 
The algorithm used here is RandomForestClassifier.

## Need of Employee Attrition prediction
 
**Managing workforce:** If the supervisors or HR came to know about some employees that they will be planning to leave the company then they could get in touch with those employees which can help them to stay back or they can manage the workforce by hiring the new alternative of those employees.

**Smooth pipeline:** If all the employees in the current project are working continuously on a project then the pipeline of that project will be smooth but if suppose one efficient asset of the project(employee) suddenly leave that company then the workflow will be not so smooth

**Hiring Management:** If HR of one particular project came to know about the employee who is willing to leave the company then he/she can manage the number of hiring and they can get the valuable asset whenever they need so for the efficient flow of work.
